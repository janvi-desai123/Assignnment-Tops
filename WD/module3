Q4) Canvas and SVG tags
Ans: Canvas and SVG are two different ways to create graphics in web development. They are both HTML5 technologies used to render graphics, but they have different approaches and use cases.
Canvas: 
The <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, including 2D shapes, text, and images, on a web page dynamically using JavaScript. It provides a bitmap-based approach where you can directly manipulate individual pixels and create animations or interactive content. The <canvas> element is a container for graphics, and you draw on it through JavaScript commands.
SVG: 
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language that defines vector-based graphics. It uses XML to describe shapes, paths, and text, and these graphics are resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality. SVG graphics are created as standalone XML files or embedded directly into an HTML document using the <svg> element.
