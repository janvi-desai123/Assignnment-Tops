The C++ programming language is categorized as a partial object-oriented programming language despite the fact that it supports OOP concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
- The major purpose of C++ programming is to introduce the concept of object orientation to the C programming language.

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.

The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as truly object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.
- Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
-  Class in C++ is the foundational element that leads to Object-Oriented programming. A class instance must be created in order to access and use the user-defined data type's data members and member functions.
- Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

Sub class - Subclass or Derived Class refers to a class that receives properties from another class.
Super class - The term "Base Class" or "Super Class" refers to the class from which a subclass inherits its properties.
- Polymorphism
When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

Different situations may cause an operation to behave differently. The type of data utilized in the operation determines the behavior.
- Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. Data abstraction is the process of exposing to the outside world only the information that is absolutely necessary while concealing implementation or background information.For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
- Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
